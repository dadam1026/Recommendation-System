Motivation

"A charity dollar has only one life; a Social Business dollar can be invested over and over again." - Muhammad Yunus

Muhammad Yunus: 
* Founder, Grameen Bank of Bangladesh 
* Recipient of the  2006 Nobel Peace Prize
* Known for creating “micro-credit,” which provides “micro” loans to the poor to serve as a catalyst for improving their socio-economic                       conditions

The bulk of consumer purchase and growth in retail is shifting towards Asia. In 2021, online retail sales in the U.S. totaled $960 Billion. China's total was $2.49 trillion and India's was 1.08 trillion. China's e-commerce market is larger than the U.S., U.K., Japan, and Germany *combined*. China has many e-commerce competitors, such as Alibaba, JD.com, Tencent, Meituan, and Pinduoduo. E-Commerce in India, Africa, and South America are more fragmented and only represents a small fraction of total retail sales. Pinduoduo, for example, is successful in China because it leverages the social networks created on the ubiquitous WeChat platform (owned by Tencent). WhatsApp (owned by Meta) has similar ubiquity in large markets such as, India, Brazil, Indonesia, the U.S., Nigeria, Egypt, and Kenya. WhatsApp is sitting on a goldmine of social networks from which group-buying can leverage to bring affordable everyday products like groceries and fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) to platform users, especially in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities. Given that the incumbents have penetrated have a vice-grip on local Chinese tastes and customs, focusing on Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities in areas where WhatsApp is most used makes more sense. Additionally, given that WhasApp and Facebook Messenger are the first and second most popular messaging apps in America, respectively, they can be used to serve food deserts, areas with low-access to healthy and affordable food and whose residents don't own a vehicle.

<br>
* The offline retail experience offers poor quality, low variety, poor targetability, and high prices 
<br>
* Social media and retail integration are here to stay and have created category defining companies and platforms, such as, Pinterest, Venmo, Instagram, and Pinduoduo 
<br>
* Engagement with consumers is key to converting into a selling opportunity
<br>
* Unique insight: pay users to generate engagement with their friends, called referral marketing
* Rise of the middle class & disposable income, internet connectivity, and mobile phone uses
* Food deserts within underdeveloped areas causes increased food insecurity and collateral damage: inhabbitants not wanting to pay for medical help since they need food


Problem Statement
-----------------
Group-Buying, an e-commerce proof of concept by China's Pinduoduo, makes use of the WeChat platform and the rise in social commerce to drive down the costs of goods for those living in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities. WhatsApp is currently
