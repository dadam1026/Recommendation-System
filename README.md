In 2021, online retail sales in the U.S. totaled $960 Billion. China's total was $2.49 trillion and India's was 1.08 trillion. China's e-commerce market is larger than the U.S., U.K., Japan, and Germany *combined*. China has many e-commerce competitors, such as Alibaba, JD.com, Tencent, Meituan, and Pinduoduo. E-Commerce in India, Africa, and South America are more fragmented and only represents a small fraction of total retail sales. Pinduoduo, for example, is successful in China because it leverages the social networks created on the ubiquitous WeChat platform (owned by Tencent). WhatsApp (owned by Meta) has similar ubiquity in large markets such as, India, Brazil, Indonesia, the U.S., Nigeria, Egypt, and Kenya. WhatsApp is sitting on a goldmine of social networks from which group-buying can leverage to bring affordable everyday products like groceries and fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) to platform users, especially in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities. Given that the incumbents have a vice-grip on local Chinese tastes and customs, focusing on Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities in areas where WhatsApp is most used, offer a more compelling value proposition. Additionally, such a platform can be levraged to provide low-cost, healthy food to *food deserts*, or undeveloped areas with increased levels of food insecurity. 

<br>
* The offline retail experience offers poor quality, low variety, poor targetability, and high prices 
<br>
* Social media and retail integration are here to stay and have created category defining companies and platforms, such as, Pinterest, Venmo, Instagram, and Pinduoduo 
<br>
* Integrated Ecosystems should be the goal. Alibaba & Tencent combine Search x Social x Commerce x Logistics x Payments
* Engagement with consumers is key to converting into a selling opportunity
<br>
* Rise of the middle class & disposable income, internet connectivity, and mobile phone uses will continue to drive e-commerce
* Food deserts within underdeveloped areas causes increased food insecurity and collateral damage: inhabbitants not wanting to pay for medical help since they need food


Problem Statement
-----------------

Group-Buying, an e-commerce proof of concept by China's Pinduoduo, makes use of the WeChat platform and the rise in social commerce to drive down the costs of goods for those living in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities. WhatsApp is currently
